#DESPCRITION

The evolution of home automation has transformed the way we interact with our everyday appliances. From remote controls to internet-connected devices, the transition has been rapid. However, in areas with limited or no internet access or where a simpler local solution is preferred, Bluetooth technology offers an effective and low-cost alternative. This project explores the development of a Bluetooth-controlled home automation system using the Arduino UNO and the HC-05 Bluetooth module. It aims to demonstrate how simple wireless communication can be used to switch electrical devices ON or OFF using a smartphone.
